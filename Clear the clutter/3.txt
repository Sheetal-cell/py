The script starts by importing the os module, which allows it to work with the file system. It defines a function called clutter that loops through all files in a directory and checks if they end with a specific extension provided by the user. If a file matches the extension, it gets renamed to a sequential number followed by its extension. For example, files ending with .txt can be renamed to 1.txt, 2.txt, etc. This approach is useful for organizing files quickly without manually renaming each one.
