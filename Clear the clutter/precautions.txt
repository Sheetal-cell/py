While the script is effective for renaming files in bulk, it’s important to use it cautiously. Once files are renamed, their original names are lost unless you have a backup. If files with the same name already exist in the directory, they may be overwritten, potentially resulting in data loss. It’s advisable to work on a copy of your files or test the script in a sample directory first. Adding features like backup creation or a confirmation prompt before renaming could make the script safer for regular use.
