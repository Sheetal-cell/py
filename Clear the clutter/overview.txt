This Python script is designed to help organize and rename files in a specified directory. By taking user input for the directory path and the desired file type (such as .txt or .jpg), it identifies all files matching the given type and renames them in a sequential order. The files are renamed to simple numbers like 1.txt, 2.txt, 3.txt, and so on, helping to declutter and simplify file names in bulk. The script uses the os module to interact with the file system, listing files and renaming them as needed.
